changes:
  - bugfix: Proper lazylist support for vehicle occupants. NPC mecha pilots can board
      mechas again. (And won't runtime when they try.) Mechs won't try to put themselves
      into themselves as an occupant when boarded by simple animal mecha pilots.
  - tweak: Removed 2 ugly pixels from the human penis size 4 erect size sprite.
