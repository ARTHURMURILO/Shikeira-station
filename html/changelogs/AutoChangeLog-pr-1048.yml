changes:
  - bugfix: Port over fixes for a number of hard-dels that could cause GC failures
      and therefore even more lag. To see the list of fixed hard-dels, see `https://github.com/SPLURT-Station/S.P.L.U.R.T-Station-13/pull/1048`.
  - bugfix: When power fails, the apc update() proc is no longer called every timer
      tick, which was unnecessary.
  - bugfix: Fixes the Cryogenic Storage Console repeating a single cryo'd person in
      the User Interface.
  - bugfix: Port over a newer /mob/Destroy() proc from TG, also making all mobs no
      longer hard-delete by default anymore.
