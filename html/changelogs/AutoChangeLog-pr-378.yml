changes:
  - rscadd: Top-left menu now has lewd sounds toggle.
  - tweak: The preference for lewd sounds is now about activating them, not muting.
      (your preferences have been automatically flipped to account for this)
  - tweak: Long strip menu is meant to be default on for sandstorm, and so it has
      been set so.
