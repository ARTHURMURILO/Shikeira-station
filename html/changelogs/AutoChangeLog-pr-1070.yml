  - rscadd: 'Added attorney-flavored emotes for when you REALLY need to throw an objection:
      *objection, *holdit, *takethat (incl. *objection0 which is without voice. You
      can set custom catchphrase by writing text after the objection emotes or similar,
      but it will be always lower-case). Plus *realize, *nani, *smirk2, *sl@ves, *assback,
      *sorryfor (gachis) and *2099 (if - god forbid - a canon event happens).'
