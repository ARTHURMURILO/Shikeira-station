changes:
  - rscadd: You can now blow kisses by using the *kiss emote (old emote is still usable
      with *kiss2). This puts a kiss object in your hand, which can be shot/thrown
      at other people to give them a mood boost. If you hit someone with the social
      anxiety quirk a few special things might happenâˆ¼!
  - rscadd: 'For coders: Also added a very easy way for coders to add new lipstick
      which special traits, with this update the kiss of death was added (admin spawn
      only), which deals damage when thrown. Have fun adding lipsticks that apply
      crocin / increase arousal when you kiss someone / throw a kiss, or straight
      up shooting lasers out of your mouth :P'
