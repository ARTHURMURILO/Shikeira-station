  - rscadd: 'Adds the Self-Actualization-Device (S.A.D.): Anyone who enters this will
      have their character re-set depending on their starting game preferences, effectively
      restoring appearance, genitals and quirks. (Very useful for those who have picked
      the DNC quirk and have been gibbed, or people who just came out of cloning).'
