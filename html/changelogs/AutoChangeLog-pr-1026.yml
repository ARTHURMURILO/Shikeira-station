changes:
  - tweak: Changes serviraptor sprites to have green service colors (using sciraptor
      as basis for edits).
  - rscadd: Added cargo raptorborgs (with bags! Thank ertyuk421).
  - rscadd: Added peacekeeper raptorborgs (using old serviraptor sprites).
  - rscdel: Removes debug ("watermark") sprite from raptorborgs and dogborgs.
  - bugfix: Modularly-added dogborgs and raptorborgs now have maintenance panel open
      sprites. Due their absence is why debug sprite was showing in first place, when
      borgs had 'em open. Do mind it was added as-is and thus isn't really neat looking.
